        Ideas
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <!-- Wealth -->
      <li><b>Wealth</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
          </li>
          <li>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - 
            to gain your financial freedom.
          </li>
          <li>Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.
            Specific knowledge is knowlege that you cannot be trained for. If society
            can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. 
          </li>
          <li>Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital,
            people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code or media).
          </li>
          <li>Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <!-- Markets -->
      <li><b>Markets</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Theory of reflexivity ('change in fundamentals + change in expectations = outcome' in complex adaptive systems, such as stock market).  
          </li>
          <li>Emotional Baggage
            <ul>
              <li>Desire to be part of the group.
                <ul>
                  <li>safety, confirmation, simplified decision-making, and fail 
                    conventionally than succeed unconventionally.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Overconfidence (on either side).
                <ul>
                  <li>know what you don't know (circle of competence).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Inability to assess probabilities rationally.
                <ul>
                  <li>Prospect Theory
                    <ul>
                      <li>Framing changes perception.</li>
                      <li>Low probablity events are overweighted and high probability
                        events are underweight (also, remember reversion to the mean is
                        a powerful force).
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Love of stories, especially when they link (even falsely) cause to 
                effect.
              </li>
              <li>Use of heuristics, or rules of thumb.
                <ul>
                  <li>Availability heuristic
                    <ul>
                      <li>We often falsely associate frequency, probability, or cause 
                        of an event by the degree to which we remember the event
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Representativeness heuristic
                    <ul>
                      <li>We gauge the probability of an event’s occurrence by our 
                        perception of the frequency of similar events</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Anchoring/adjusting heuristic</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

          </li>
          <li>Markets as Complex Adaptive System
            <ul>
              <li>Aggregation - complex, large-scale behaviors from aggregate interactions.</li>
              <li>Adaptive schema - individual schemas (decision rules of individuals 
                formulated based on their interaction with the environment (input/output of
                information)) compete based on their 'fitness'.
              </li>
              <li>Nonlinearity - cause and effect are not simplistically linked.</li>
              <li>Feedback loops - positive and negative feedback loops (multiplier effect,
                 theory of reflexivity, etc).
              </li>
              <li>Critical points - periodically, small-scale stimuli lead to large-scale
                effects ('straw that broke the camel's back').
              </li>
              <li>Intelligence - market is often rational/intelligent event though it is  
                made up of irrational/'dumb' individual agents. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Business landscape is like a biological ecosystem - at first, it 
            increases the number of species; subsequently, extinction occurs, leaving
            a handful of 'fit' species dominating the field.
          </li>

      </li>

      <!-- General -->
      <li><b>General</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Family is the most important thing.</li>
          <li>Parents are the only true friends.</li>
          <li>Know yourself.</li>
          <li>Learn from mistakes.</li>
          <li>Pick partners with high integrity, intelligence, and energy.</li>
          <li>Have low expectations from life and high expectations from yourself.</li>
          <li>Don’t fool yourself, and remember you are the easiest person to fool.</li>
          <li>Envy, ostentation and conceit are a ticket to the most misable movie.</li>
          <li>Everything has an appropriate cost (e.g. too good to be true is often too good to be true)</li>
          <li>Incentives, incentives.</li>
          <li>Invert, always invert.</li>
          <li>Garbage in, garbage out.</li>
          <li>Self-pity is never helpful; accept, learn, and move on.</li>
          <li>So much of getting good at anything is just pure labor.</li>
          <li>There is no speed limit in learning (e.g. bachelors degree could be earned in less than 4 years).</li>
          <li>To those who have everything more will be given and from those 
            who have nothing everything will be taken ( = the law of economic 
            productivity (pareto distribution) - the square root of the number 
            of people in a productive domain produce half of the output).
          </li>
        </ul>
