        <p class="blogPostBody">In the early 1970s, an ounce of gold was ~$30. Today, the figure is in the $1280s.
            What this means is that in the past 50 years, the value of gold is increased ~40X. Sure, no big deal, right?.
            After all, everything one can think of has had the similar story in its price journey over the past five decades. 
            Except, if we change our perspective a bit and think about any good in terms of its value instead of its price, things
            start to get really interesting. So coming back to the gold and its price, what if we look at the problem from the dollar's 
            perspective - that is, instead of the value of an ounce of gold increasing ~40X, what if we say that the value of dollar
            decreased ~1/40X. This realization might seem an obvious observation for some, but for me, it is one of those 'aha' moments
            that the first few pages of the selected reading materials provide. And the book is one of those.

        <p class="blogPostBody">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions 
            of Lorem Ipsum.
