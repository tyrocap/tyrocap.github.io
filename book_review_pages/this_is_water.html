        <h2>
           'This is Water' by David Wallace 
        </h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>The most important/obvious realities are often the ones that are
                hardest to see and talk about. 
            </li>
            <li>Huge percentage of stuff that we tend to be automatically certain
                of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded.
            </li>
            <li>People's natural default setting is being self-centered. So it
                takes an effort to see the world from other's perspective.
            </li>
            <li>The most important function of education is to teach how to
                exercise control over how and what to think (What to pay 
                attention to and How to construct meaning from experience). 
                After all, the mind is 'an excellent servant but a terrible
                master.'
            </li>
            <li>Whole large part of adult American life involves boredom,
                routine, and petty frustration. When you reach this stage,
                it is really important to have true 'education' - fight your
                natural default setting and choose what to pay attention to 
                and how to derive meaning from experience. You always have 
                other options.
            </li>
            <li>In the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually
                not such thing as atheism. Everybody worships. The only choice
                we get is what to worship. And if you choose anything else but
                some sort god or spiritual-thing, that thing will eat you alive.
                Money and things? You will never have enough. Your body/beauty/
                sexual allure? You will always feel ugly and when the age 
                knocks the door, you will die a million death before your last
                breath. Power? You will always feel weak and afraid, and you
                will need ever more power to keep fear at bay. Intellect? You
                will always feel stupid and fraud. And so on.. 
            </li>
            <li>The real freedom involves attention, and awareness, and 
                discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care 
                about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and 
                over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. The 
                alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, 
                "the rat race". 
            </li>
