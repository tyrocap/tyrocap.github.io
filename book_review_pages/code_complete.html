            'Code Complete' by Steve McConnell
        </h2>
        <ul> 
            <h2>Chapter 1:</h2> 
            <li>
                Detailed design -> coding -> debugging -> integration -> developer testing (unit/integration).
            </li>
            <li>
                Plan to throw away. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>  
            <h2>Chapter 2:</h2> 
            <li>Appeal to logic, analogy, and data.</li>
            <li>Foundation is problem definition.</li> 
            <li>
                Remove assumptions. Have clearly written requirements/design/etc (checklist). That said, 
                know they will evolve(ch1).
            </li> 
            <li>Make sure that every decision is explained clearly.</li>
            <li>Error processing is a beast on its own. Don't forget about 'Fault Tolerance'. (checklist)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul> 
            <h2>Chapter 4:</h2> 
            <li>
                Understand the distinction between 'programming in a language' (#) vs 'programming into a language' (*).
                In #, foundation is the language. In *, it is the problem definition. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul> 
            <h2>Chapter 5:</h2> 
            <li>Design is nothing but tradeoffs and priorities.</li>
            <li>Things have essential and accidental properties. Car's engine (should be paid more attention) vs its shiny logo. 
                Software is no different.</li>
            <li>Simplify as much as possible. Not more. Software -> subsystems/packages -> classes</li>
            <li>Use design patterns/std.lib as much as possible.</li>
        </ul>
