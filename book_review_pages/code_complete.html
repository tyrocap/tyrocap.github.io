            <ul> Chapter 1: 
                <li>
                    Detailed design -> coding -> debugging -> integration -> developer testing (unit/integration).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plan to throw away.

        <p class="blogPostBody">
            <ul> Chapter 2:  
                <li>Appeal to logic, analogy, and data.</li>
                <li>Foundation is problem definition.</li> 
                <li>
                    Remove assumptions. Have clearly written requirements/design/etc (checklist). That said, 
                    know they will evolve(ch1).
                </li> 
                <li>Make sure that every decision is explained clearly.</li>
                <li>Error processing is a beast on its own. Don't forget about 'Fault Tolerance'. (checklist)</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="blogPostBody">
            <ul> Chapter 4:
                <li>
                    Understand the distinction between 'programming in a language' (#) vs 'programming into a language' (*).
                    In #, foundation is the language. In *, it is the problem definition.

        <p class="blogPostBody">
            <ul> Chapter 5:
                <li>Design is nothing but tradeoffs and priorities.</li>
                <li>Things have essential and accidental properties. Car's engine (should be paid more attention) vs its shiny logo. 
                    Software is no different.</li>
                <li>Simplify as much as possible. Not more. Software -> subsystems/packages -> classes</li>
                <li>Use design patterns/std.lib as much as possible.</li>
            </ul>
