        <h2>
           'The Bitcoin Standard' by Saifedean Ammous 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Historically, money has been a good that filfulls 3 reqs: a medium of exchange, 
            store of value, and unit of account. As long as those 3 boxes were checked, any 
            good (seashells, stones, metals, paper) could be chosed as money. This has been
            true except in cases where the supply of that good was not stable. Once there is
            a way to inflate the market with money supply (the ratio of new supply is relatively 
            high compared to all of the existing amount), the good stops to be an effective 
            as money since the 'supplier' side has the opportunity to spend beyond their means by 
            supplying new money, which is essentially eating away wealth of people who 
            hold the existing money.    
        </p>
        <br>

            As we became more and more advanced in all aspects of our lives, money also evolved.
            Specifically, it increasingly became harder to do business with physical form of money,
            which has all kinds of problems: inefficient to move around, cannot support large
            transactions, etc. So, we came up with paper money, which seemingly addressed all of 
            the pain-points that came with metal coins or pieces of stones. Except, we forgot about the supply
            problem - that is, money stops to be effective as soon as someone has the ability
            to print money, which we granted to our governments. Result? Endless mess - financial
            disasters, recessions, depressions, wars, etc.   
        </p>
        <p>
            With that backdrop, we enter the digital era, where we are faced with two challenges:
            paper money seems to have the same physical limitation when it is viewed on digital 
            world lens; it also has a supplier problem, as we talked above. What can be done?
            Well, here Bitcoin comes into the scene. It is the first truly digital solution to
            the problem of intermediaries of money. It is essentially a peer-to-peer form of 
            electronic cash that does not require trust in third-parties in handling transactions
            and whose supply cannot be altered by any other party.
