Don't practice what you don't want to become. Suppose you want to do something
difficult, what happens usually is your brain will throw something easier to
accomplish and if you take that, that thing will slowly be built into
neurological circuits, which are very hard to undo (once you get into some
habit, it is very hard to get rid of them). 

Most ideas, at least moral ones, are already ingrained in us and you can see
that by noticing that we act those ideas out most of the times. The intersting
thing about those implicit moral ideas is that once they are made explicit
(that aha moment) by some accidential event, they become much more powerful
because in some sense we understand them and can incorporate them into our
daily existence. 

Be a monster and incorporate that into your being so that when some cheater (in
its broadest sense) comes along, you can punish that person. After that,
however, you welcome that person back into the game (in its broadest sense).
The same strategy must be applied to your daily life, where you should be able
to say no and negotiate on your behalf. In this case, your potential punishment
to the other player is you leave and that employer (for example) will lose its 
important employee.
