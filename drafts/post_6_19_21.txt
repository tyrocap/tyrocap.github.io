The classic scientific idea is someting like this: you perceive a universe of
facts, derive conclusions and act; this is wrong idea because we live in a
world of relevance - that is, you see only a narrow spectrum of facts available
to you at any given moment in time. Other facts (in its broadest sense) are
ignored and low-resolution (just like your vision). In this context, there are
unlimited number of facts and you choose some of them (otherwise, it is
impossible to exist) and this in itself is ethics. In other words, your
perception is a form of ethics because it lets you see the world through
certain lens and not others. 

One interesting observation is sometime in the first half of your life you
have to sacrifice your childhood self, who is full of potential and stuff, to
the actuality of the next phase of your life. This is worth thinking about
becomes this 'maturation' process happens whether or not you want it. The
importnat thing is you have the option to choose that limitation or let the
world harshly decide it for you. In this context, choosing it yourself and
doing so early is optimal for you because you can properly prepare yourself 
(physically, emotionally, financially, etc) to the obstacles that come with 
that limitation. If you choose to ignore it, you become an old infant - an ugly
thing (Choose your damn sacrifice!).
